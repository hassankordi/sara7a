### This project is dynamic and responsive on all devices, I have used nodeJS and Angular to create this project and it has the following features.

The first page is home and this page contains some info about me.
The register page is for registration and creating a new account.
After login, you will go to the profile and find all the hidden messages that have been sent to you and no one can know the sender.
On the profile page, you can copy your link and share it to receive more hidden messages from your friends.
